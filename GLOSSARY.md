### FIX

Financial Information eXchange, a messaging protocol used to communicate financial information and instructions. It provides conventions for encoding messages, but implementations can differ by protocol version and venue-specific requirements, so support for FIX alone does not guarantee drop-in compatibility.

### Tag

A numeric field identifier in a FIX message, paired with a value in `tag=value` form. Tags identify items such as message type or instrument. Applications should use a clear internal mapping and validate required fields against the relevant protocol and venue rules.

### SOH

Start of Header, the ASCII control byte `0x01` used to separate FIX fields. A printable character such as a vertical bar may represent SOH in documentation, but must not replace the actual byte in a transmitted message.

### BodyLength

The value in FIX tag 9, giving the byte length of the message body: the bytes after the delimiter ending tag 9 and before the start of tag 10. It must be calculated from the serialized byte sequence, including field delimiters.

### Checksum

The value in FIX tag 10, calculated from the message bytes preceding that tag according to the protocol’s checksum rule. It is a transmission-format check, not proof that the message is valid for a venue or that an order is safe or accepted.

### Session

An established exchange of messages between identified sender and target systems. A session includes connection and lifecycle behavior such as logon and logout; exact authentication, recovery, and required message fields depend on the counterparty’s specification.

### Venue adapter

A software boundary that translates internal application concepts into a particular broker’s or trading venue’s interface. It isolates differences in fields, supported order types, and connection conventions from strategy and domain logic.

### Syntactic validity

Conformance to a message’s structural rules, such as field encoding and required formatting. A syntactically valid request may still be semantically inappropriate, unauthorized, unsupported, or outside risk limits.

### Ragged row

A CSV data record whose number of fields differs from the number of header columns. In this utility, such rows are reported by file line number and excluded from per-column statistics because their values cannot be safely aligned to the header.

### Finite numeric value

A value successfully parsed as a number that is neither positive infinity, negative infinity, nor NaN. The CSV profiler includes finite numeric values in counts and summaries, while excluding nonfinite values from those calculations.

### JSON

JavaScript Object Notation, a text format for representing values such as objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and null. Its flexibility makes it useful for exchanging data, but records in one file may have different keys or nested shapes, so successful parsing does not guarantee consistent meaning.

### Semi-structured data

Data that has some organization, such as named fields or nested objects, without requiring every record to follow one fixed table schema. JSON and HTML-derived records are common examples. Consumers usually need to inspect and normalize the structure before treating values as consistent analytical variables.

### Data validation

Checks that data and configuration meet declared expectations, such as required fields, types, permitted ranges, or a valid graph shape. Validation can detect specified problems, but it cannot establish that the expectations are scientifically appropriate or that untested data properties are correct.

### Dependency graph

A representation of tasks as nodes and prerequisite relationships as directed edges. An edge from task A to task B means B requires A to finish first. Making these relationships explicit helps teams review execution order and spot missing or contradictory prerequisites.

### Directed acyclic graph (DAG)

A directed graph with no directed path that loops back to its starting node. A DAG admits at least one topological ordering, making it useful for workflows where tasks have prerequisites but no iterative cycles.

### Topological order

A sequence of a graph’s nodes in which each node appears after all of its prerequisites. Such an order exists for a directed acyclic graph and may not be unique. The order satisfies declared constraints but does not by itself optimize runtime or validate the tasks.

### Cycle

A directed path that returns to its starting node. In a dependency graph, a cycle means that tasks in the loop cannot all be scheduled in a one-pass prerequisite order. It may indicate an erroneous dependency or an iterative process that needs a different workflow model.

### Kahn’s algorithm

A topological-sorting method that repeatedly removes nodes with no remaining prerequisites and releases their dependents. If nodes remain when no more nodes are ready, the graph contains a cycle or nodes blocked downstream from one.

### Deterministic ordering

A rule that produces the same sequence from the same graph and implementation choices. Choosing the lexicographically smallest currently ready node makes this utility’s output repeatable, but does not make task results deterministic if inputs or computations vary.

### Workflow orchestration

The coordination of tasks and their dependencies, often including when tasks run and how failures are handled. A topological ordering provides a possible sequence for an acyclic workflow, while production orchestration may additionally require scheduling, retries, monitoring, and provenance.

## 2026-10-08

Source note: [2026-10-08](articles/2026-10-08-machine-signals-manufacturing-decisions.md).

### Smart manufacturing

A manufacturing approach that connects production operations with data and complementary technologies to improve visibility, coordination, and decision-making. It can include IoT, analytics, automation, cloud services, and enterprise-system integration, rather than referring to one specific machine or platform.

### Digital thread

An integrated view that links information across manufacturing processes and stages of a product's life cycle, such as design, production, use, service, repair, and decommissioning. Useful links require consistent identity and context across systems; sensor installation alone does not guarantee a functioning thread.

### Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)

A metric expressed as the product of availability, performance, and quality. Its value depends on clearly defined time boundaries, speed baselines, and quality denominators. It describes performance under those definitions but does not, by itself, explain causes or prove an intervention worked.

### Operational Technology (OT)

Technology used to monitor or control physical industrial processes. Examples include programmable logic controllers, SCADA, and CNC systems. OT environments can have different availability, network, and security requirements from business-focused IT systems.

### Information Technology (IT)

Technology commonly used to process, store, and exchange organizational information. In manufacturing integrations, IT may consume or contextualize data from OT, but the two environments should not be treated as interchangeable in their operational and security needs.

### Discrete manufacturing

Production of distinct, countable products or parts, such as furniture, machine components, or phones. Individual units or lots may be tracked through production and later life-cycle stages when identifiers and connected records are available.

### Process manufacturing

Production that transforms ingredients or raw materials using recipes and physical or chemical processes. Because inputs and outputs may not be individually countable like discrete items, useful records may focus on batches, recipes, quantities, and process conditions.

### Manufacturing Execution System (MES)

Software that monitors, tracks, controls, or synchronizes production execution, including tasks and schedules. MES capabilities can overlap with broader smart-manufacturing systems, so integration or replacement work should first clarify existing system responsibilities.

### SCADA

Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems monitor and control industrial processes, often providing operators with real-time or near-real-time visualization and control interfaces. SCADA may contribute to a wider smart-manufacturing environment but is not equivalent to every capability in that environment.

### Industry 5.0

A human-centric framing of industrial development that emphasizes collaboration between people and machines, sustainability, responsibility, and attention to societal needs. It broadens the goals beyond optimization and efficiency alone.

### Data visualization

A purposeful visual representation of data, such as a chart, map, or graph, intended to help people inspect or communicate information. A visualization can reveal patterns, trends, and outliers, but its usefulness depends on the underlying data and the choices made in constructing and interpreting the display.

### DUSSSS

A six-part visualization framework named in the chapter: Data, User, Strategy, Structure, Style, and Story. It prompts a designer or engineering team to consider evidence, audience, purpose, organization, appearance, and intended takeaway as connected decisions rather than treating chart styling as the whole task.

### Nominal data

Categorical data whose labels have no inherent ordering, such as service names or colors. Assigning numeric codes to nominal categories does not make them quantities. Charts and calculations should preserve the distinction between category identity and measured magnitude.

### Ordinal data

Categorical data with a meaningful order, such as low, medium, and high. The ordering is informative, but the gaps between levels are not necessarily equal. Treating ordinal codes as measurements with equal intervals requires additional justification.

### Data strategy

Planning for how data are captured, extracted, cleaned, integrated, and maintained for a visualization or analysis. It includes considering source quality and update behavior, so the displayed information is fit for the question and does not imply more freshness or completeness than the pipeline provides.

### Structure

The organization of the data and the presentation, including what appears, in what order, at what level of detail, and how often it refreshes. A clear structure helps users navigate information and understand the relationship between the displayed evidence and the question being asked.

### Outlier

An observation that differs noticeably from others in a dataset or context. An outlier may signal a real unusual event, a measurement problem, or a data-processing issue. Its appearance on a chart is a reason to investigate, not automatic proof that it should be removed.

### JSON Lines

A text format in which each nonblank line contains a separate JSON value, commonly one record per line. Because records can be read independently, JSON Lines is practical for streamed exports and pipeline handoffs. A particular consumer may impose further requirements, such as requiring every record to be an object.

### Field type consistency

The degree to which a named field appears with the same decoded data type across records. A field that alternates between a number and a string may complicate downstream processing. An observed type count is a diagnostic, not a declaration of which type is correct.

### Missing-field count

A count of valid object records that do not contain a particular field. It differs from a field whose value is explicitly null: the field is present in the latter case. Missingness can affect analysis and should be understood before summaries or visualizations are interpreted.
